* Cpu Rust Emulator
A simple and understandable cpu emulator written in rust :spaceship:!


* Installation
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/dazai-osamu-san/rust-cpu-emu.git
#+end_src
Once the repository is cloned

#+begin_src bash
cd rust-cpu-emu
#+end_src


* Usage
A cpu operates with opcodes, similary a system of opcodes is implemented.

Opcodes go in the instruction memory which starts from 0 1023 is instruction memory and 1024 to 4096 is memory.

** Writing your own instructions
Open the src/main.rs file in your favourite editor(emacs) and just follow the following instructions.
*** OPCODE: 0 Write to Memory

The write to memory function is used to store data at a specific memory address.

*Instruction Format:*

- Opcode: 0
- Length: 3 bytes

*Instruction Description:*

To write to memory, follow these steps:

1. Choose a memory address (`addr`) where you want to store the data.
2. Determine the value (`data`) you want to write to memory.
3. Call the `write_memory` function on the `cpu` instance, passing the following arguments:
   - Argument 1 (`x`): The starting address of the instruction (usually the current program counter).
   - Argument 2 (`0`): The opcode value, which is `0` for the write to memory instruction.
   - Argument 3 (`addr`): The memory address where you want to store the data.
   - Argument 4 (`data`): The value you want to write to memory.

*Example:*

Suppose you want to write the value `42` to memory address `1000`. You can use the following code:

#+begin_src rust
cpu.write_memory(x, 0);           // Opcode: 0 (write to memory)
cpu.write_memory(x + 1, 1000);    // Memory address: 1000
cpu.write_memory(x + 2, 42);      // Data: 42
#+end_src


*** OPCODE: 1 Load from Memory

The load from memory function is used to retrieve data from a specific memory address and store it in a register.

*Instruction Format:*

- Opcode: 1
- Length: 2 bytes

*Instruction Description:*

To load from memory, follow these steps:

    Specify the memory address (addr) from which you want to retrieve the data.
    Call the write_memory function on the cpu instance, passing the following arguments:
        Argument 1 (x): The starting address of the instruction (usually the current program counter).
        Argument 2 (1): The opcode value, which is 1 for the load from memory instruction.
        Argument 3 (addr): The memory address from which you want to load the data.

*Example:*

Suppose you want to load data from memory address 2000 into register 0. You can use the following code:

#+begin_src rust
cpu.write_memory(x, 1);           // Opcode: 1 (load from memory)
cpu.write_memory(x + 1, 2000);    // Memory address: 2000
#+end_src


*** OPCODE: 2 ADD

The ADD instruction performs addition between the values in two registers and stores the result in register 0.

*Instruction Format:*

    Opcode: 2
    Length: 1 byte

*Instruction Description:*

To perform the ADD operation, follow these steps:

    Call the execute method on the cpu instance to execute the instruction.

*Example:*
#+begin_src rust
cpu.write_memory(x, 2);  // Opcode: 2 (ADD)
#+end_src

*** OPCODE: 3 SUB

The SUB instruction performs subtraction between the values in two registers and stores the result in register 0.

*Instruction Format:*

    Opcode: 3
    Length: 1 byte

*Instruction Description:*

To perform the SUB operation, follow these steps:

    Call the execute method on the cpu instance to execute the instruction.

*Example:*

#+begin_src rust
cpu.write_memory(x, 3);  // Opcode: 3 (SUB)
#+end_src
